    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <h4>Step 1: Preparing the Paneer</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix cornflour, all-purpose flour, black pepper powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add water gradually to form a smooth, thick batter.</li>
            <li>Dip paneer cubes into the batter, ensuring they're well-coated.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a frying pan and deep-fry or shallow-fry the coated paneer cubes until golden and crispy. Remove and set aside on a paper towel to drain excess oil.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Step 2: Preparing the Sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or large pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add chopped garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Saut√© until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Toss in diced onions and capsicum. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until slightly tender but still crunchy.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Step 3: Making the Sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add soy sauce, red chili sauce, tomato ketchup, vinegar, and sugar (if using). Mix well.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and black pepper powder. Adjust sauces to taste.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Step 4: Combining the Paneer</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the fried paneer cubes to the sauce. Toss gently to coat them evenly.</li>
            <li>If you prefer a thicker sauce, mix 1 teaspoon of cornflour with 2 tablespoons of water to make a slurry, and add it to the pan. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Step 5: Garnishing and Serving</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn off the heat and garnish with chopped spring onion greens.</li>
            <li>Serve hot as an appetizer or pair it with fried rice or noodles for a complete meal.</li>
        </ol>
